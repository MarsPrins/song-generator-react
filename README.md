Project goal:
I noticed that finding new music that I liked was a task that shouldn't be as hard as it was. Searching through every streaming platform only to find maybe 1 / 2 songs that i kind of liked, i wanted to find a better and faster method.

Solution:
I decided to build a modern looking quiz that would calculate the perfect song with the given answers, your result can also be shared with others where they can then also do their own quiz and get their own result. It's a fun and useful way to get introduced to new music genres and find new stuff to listen to!

• Built with ReactJS, SCSS and is fully responsive

• I worked in a team of 1, myself
